# Django Website Project

Hello everyone!

This is my website, built using Django. I consider it a foundational framework for my future projects and plan to refine it further. I welcome any contributions and feedback!

## Instructions for Running the Project Locally

If you're new to Django or need help setting up the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/Dabro008/DjangoApp.git`

Make sure the path to manage.py is correct. For example: `.../test/DjangoApp`

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

`python3 -m venv venv`
Activate the virtual environment:

* On macOS/Linux:

`source venv/bin/activate`

* On Windows:

`venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3. Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary dependencies using pip:

`pip install django pillow`
### 4. Run the Development Server
Navigate to the directory containing manage.py and start the Django development server:

`python3 manage.py runserver`

### Once the server is running, open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the website.

### Contributing
I welcome any contributions! If you'd like to help improve this project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Future Plans
* Refine the existing features.

* Add new functionality to make the project more robust.

* Use this as a template for future Django projects.
